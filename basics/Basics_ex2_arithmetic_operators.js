2. Use the arithmetic operators to determine the individual digits of a 4-digit number like 4936:

thousands place is 4
hundreds place is 9
tens place is 3
ones place is 6

START STATE: Four digit number input
GOAL STATE: logging seperated individual digits
CONSTRANTS: use arithmitic operators

/**
hint: Use number % 10 to determine the rightmost digit. Then use that value and % again to get the tens digit. Repeat until you have all 4 digits.

hint: Once you have the ones digit from the previous hint, subtract it from the current number, then divide the result by 10. Repeat hint 1 to get the next digit.
